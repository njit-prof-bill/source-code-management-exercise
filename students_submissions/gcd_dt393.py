    # calculate the greatest common denominator:

    # recursively call the euclidean algorithm:
    # assuming we avoided the edge cases:
    
        # For values like A=10 and B = 0, the immediate return is A;
        # For Values A = 0 and B = 10, the next iteration will be gcd(B=10, and A%B == 0%10 == 0),
        #  which becomes gcd(10, 0), which is A==10 as well;
        #  
        # The algorithm, will mod the smaller into the larger;
        # If that value is 0, that is the gcd. Otherwise, the remainder is then put back into
        # The function with the previous B value, and they are again checked.
        # 
        # But, in general:
        # Example:
        # -> gcd(54, 24) B==0 ? No -> gcd(24, 54%24==6) B==0?No -> gcd(6, 24%6==0) B==0? Yes, return A==6 as gcd;
        # 

    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b, a % b)




# Test cases
print(gcd(54, 24))  # Expected output: 6
print(gcd(48, 18))  # Expected output: 16
print(gcd(101, 10))  # Expected output: 1


# Edge Case Tests:
# primes, zeroes, etc
# print(gcd(101, 101))
# print(gcd(24, 54))

# print(gcd(0, 5))
# print(gcd(5, 0))

# print(gcd(0, 4))
# print(gcd(4, 0))


# print(gcd(4, -5))
# print(gcd(40, 2))
